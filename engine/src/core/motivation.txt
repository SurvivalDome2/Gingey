I have this four-step method that I use
0:03
to stay motivated and get stuff done
0:06
especially on the days where I feel
0:07
tired or lazy or even burnt out over the
0:11
past 11 years I have been working 60 to
0:14
100 hours a week studying full-time
0:17
graduating medicine starting my own
0:19
business working as a learning coach
0:21
while working as a doctor and most
0:23
people think I am highly motivated but
0:25
honestly I think I'm a pretty lazy
0:28
person and I've been demotivated and
0:31
burnt out more times than I can count
0:33
but by using this four-step method I've
0:35
been able to stay productive and work
0:37
towards my goal in a way that is
0:40
actually sustainable and mentally
0:42
healthy I call this four-step method
0:45
defuse because by following each of
0:48
these four steps you're able to activate
0:50
something called thought action defusion
0:53
which is a cognitive technique commonly
0:55
used in Clinical Psychology being able
0:57
to activate thought action defusion is
1:00
almost like a superpower and virtually
1:02
anyone can learn to do it I'll go over
1:04
each of the four steps of defuse in more
1:06
detail but before that we need to
1:09
understand that there are actually two
Theory behind motivation
1:11
different ways that we can use
1:13
motivation one of them is healthy and
1:15
productive but the other much more
1:18
common way can actually ruin our
1:20
productivity and lead to burnout and
1:22
once we understand the right versus
1:24
wrong way of using motivation you'll see
1:26
why the defuse method works so well so
1:29
let's say that we have a goal for the
1:31
day and that goal might be to go for a
1:33
run it might be to do some study or
1:36
whatever other task that you have on
1:38
your mind naturally in order for us to
1:40
accomplish this goal we first need to
1:42
want to accomplish it and that's where
1:44
we have intention and after that we take
1:46
a series of actions to help us reach
1:50
that goal now if our goal was to uh go
1:53
for a run it might be putting on our
1:55
shoes if it was to study it might be
1:57
going to our desk opening up our laptop
1:59
getting our textbook out starting to
2:02
read and write some notes these are the
2:04
actions that help us achieve the goal
2:05
but in reality what actually happens
2:09
when we try to reach the goal what
2:11
happens is that we get
2:13
distracted we procrastinate or maybe we
2:16
start feeling lazy or tired so between
2:19
the intention and our first few actions
2:22
all of these barriers start forming that
2:25
stop us from achieving our goal which
2:26
means no running no studying task
2:29
incomplete that is where motivation
2:31
comes in motivation gives us that extra
2:34
energy the extra incentive to overcome
2:37
these barriers to peel our eyes away
2:39
from those distractions to uh persevere
2:42
and push through even though we feel
2:44
lazy or that we feel tired at the end of
2:46
the day motivation is this feeling that
2:49
allows us to push through and overcome
2:52
these barriers this is the first and
2:55
most common way that people use
2:58
motivation and that is a major problem
3:03
because this way of using motivation is
3:05
something that I call
3:07
motivation dependent and before I go
3:10
through the defuse method you have to
3:12
understand why this is such a problem
3:15
because I genuinely believe that if you
3:17
are motivation dependent you will
3:19
struggle to get stuff done for most of
3:23
your life because here's the fundamental
3:25
flaw with motivation that you need to
3:28
know there's a lot of research around
3:29
motiv a what it is where it comes from
3:32
what influences it if you want me to go
3:34
deeper in this let me know in the
3:35
comments but what we know is that
3:37
motivation originates from many
3:40
different sources we can be
3:42
extrinsically motivated by things like
3:44
money a reward social status or even
3:48
fear of punishment but we can also be
3:50
intrinsically motivated which is where
3:53
the motivation comes from within our own
3:55
mind this includes things like a sense
3:57
of satisfaction from fulfilling
3:59
something or a sense of purpose and
4:02
fulfillment from doing something that
4:04
feels aligned to your values and sense
4:07
of identity and it includes also just
4:09
simply enjoying the task itself and here
4:13
is where being motivation dependent
The problem with motivation
4:16
becomes problematic and therefore why
4:19
the defuse method is so much better see
4:22
extrinsic motivators tend to be out of
4:24
our control and they go up and down for
4:27
example what happens if we get paid paid
4:30
less or more or we're around different
4:32
people to compare ourselves to or we're
4:35
around different people who value
4:37
different things and so they judge you
4:39
differently when we are motivated by
4:42
those extrinsic things then our
4:44
motivation fluctuates wildly it feels
4:47
unstable and insecure because they
4:50
depend on things that we can't control
4:51
on the other hand intrinsic motivators
4:53
tend to be more stable for example our
4:56
values or the things that we enjoy don't
4:59
tend to FL uate so rapidly but even
5:02
intrinsic motivators can fluctuate for
5:05
example how much sleep we get and how
5:07
energized we feel our mood on that day
5:10
or our physical health all of these
5:13
things affect our level of motivation on
5:16
any given day so why is that actually a
5:19
problem well what all of that means is
5:22
that our motivation is always going to
5:25
go up and down it's always going to
5:28
fluctuate and if you're AB ility to get
5:30
stuff done depends on your motivation
5:34
then your ability to be productive is
5:36
also going to fluctuate and if what you
5:39
do depends on how you feel then the only
5:42
way to be consistent is to feel
5:46
consistently great that is not a
5:48
realistic or a reliable way to reach our
5:51
goals in fact there's even some research
5:53
around something called willpower
5:54
depletion which says that if we
5:56
consistently rely on our motivation and
5:58
willpower to get stuff done and resist
6:01
Temptations then eventually we'll sort
6:04
of run out of willpower and some
6:06
researchers think that this is actually
6:08
what burnout is they call it the burnout
6:11
cycle where you constantly try to do
6:13
something and then you have to have more
6:15
and more effort and willpower to get it
6:17
done and then you're constantly
6:18
overcoming barriers until there's no
6:20
more motivation or energy left to give
6:23
so what is the alternative way of using
6:25
motivation the alternative much
6:27
healthier and more consistent way of
6:29
using motivation is something that I
6:31
call motivation enhanced and becoming
6:35
motivation enhanced rather than
6:36
motivation dependent is what the entire
6:38
defuse method is based on being
6:41
motivation enhanced means that you can
6:43
be motivated but you don't need to be
6:47
personally I don't feel motivated most
6:51
days I don't feel demotivated but I just
6:54
don't live every day like full of hype I
6:57
keep that motivation in reserve on the
7:00
days that I really need to use it
7:02
instead of just using it to get through
7:05
my daily tasks then how am I overcoming
7:08
those barriers of laziness or being
7:11
distracted or feeling tired on a daily
7:13
basis we do it by following the four
7:15
steps of the defuse method the first
Step 1
7:18
step of Defuse The D is for distinguish
7:22
distinguish means to recognize the
7:24
difference between
7:27
feelings thoughts
7:31
and
7:32
actions for example think about when you
7:35
feel hungry hunger is a physical
7:38
sensation it's a feeling and when we
7:40
feel hunger we have the thought I must
7:46
eat and then we perform the action of
7:49
eating and normally all three of these
7:53
are actually fused together but they
7:55
don't have to be we could feel hunger as
7:59
okay I just feel this sensation in my
8:03
stomach that tells me that I am hungry
8:05
we just notice that we don't have to act
8:08
on it we just notice it just like how we
8:10
might notice that there's a breeze
8:12
touching our arm and by doing that we
8:14
can see Hunger as a physical Sensation
8:17
that isn't always connected to the
8:20
thought I must eat and that actually
8:23
makes the feeling of hunger not bother
8:25
us as much because we no longer have to
8:28
do something about it this is actually
8:29
strategy I used to use all the time as a
8:31
doctor where I'd often not have enough
8:33
time to have lunch or dinner but I still
8:36
needed to work effectively now of course
8:38
it this is temporary you will eventually
8:41
have to eat you can't just thought
8:42
action diffuse your way to immortality
8:45
now in Clinical Psychology when what we
8:48
do our actions are directly tie to our
8:51
feelings and our thoughts that's called
8:53
thought action fusion and so being able
8:55
to separate that is thought action
8:57
defusion this actually comes up a lot in
8:58
anxiety y therapy the feelings of
9:01
anxiety are a physical sensation our
9:04
hands are getting clammy they're shaking
9:06
a bit we feel that our heart racing
9:08
we're actually feeling these physical
9:11
symptoms of an adrenaline response our
9:13
body entering the fight or flight mode
9:15
and it's actually the exact same
9:16
response as if you were really excited
9:18
about something the physical Sensations
9:20
aren't inherently negative but if you
9:22
have anxiety you notice these symptoms
9:25
and then you tell yourself I am anxious
9:29
and we enter an anxious spiral where
9:32
realizing that we are feeling these
9:34
things and therefore we're anxious makes
9:36
us feel even more anxious so step one of
9:39
defuse is to distinguish between a
9:42
feeling and a thought to recognize that
9:45
we can feel something but we can control
9:49
the way we respond and react to that
9:52
feeling and I actually used this method
9:54
before my Ted X talk a couple of years
9:56
ago where I was feeling really nervous
9:58
before I and I I felt those physical
10:01
Sensations and instead of letting myself
10:03
think I feel this and therefore I'm
10:05
anxious I reframed it to be hey I'm
10:08
getting this adrenaline response I'm
10:11
excited I'm about to crush this thing
10:13
and by reframing that physical feeling
10:16
and changing the thought I had from it
10:19
and actually helped me to be a lot more
10:21
confident and that tedex talk ended up
10:23
becoming one of the uh top 1% most
10:26
viewed tedex talks of 2022 by the way
10:29
way I've summarized the main points from
10:31
that tedex talk into my free Weekly
10:34
Newsletter as well where I try to impart
10:37
the advice that will improve your
10:39
learning efficiency every week through
10:42
your inbox it's completely free and if
10:44
you're interested in joining I'll leave
10:45
a link in the description for you so
10:47
next time you feel tired or lazy
10:50
recognize that it's just a feeling you
10:52
feel tired cool feeling lazy that's fine
10:56
but we distinguish between that feeling
10:59
and then what comes after that which is
11:01
the thought which we can control and
11:03
controlling those thoughts is step two
Step 2
11:06
of Defuse The if which stands for fake
11:10
you've heard of fake it till you make it
11:12
well it's kind of the same for this as
11:14
well think about this when you watch a
11:16
movie and you see an actor or an actress
11:19
you know that they're not actually that
11:21
character you know that they are acting
11:23
and if an actor arrives on set feeling
11:26
tired or lazy guess what they can still
11:29
act like their character who is not
11:33
tired or lazy so instead of I feel lazy
11:37
and tired therefore I must rest and then
11:42
not do anything we can use fake to say I
11:46
feel lazy and tired that's fine I'm just
11:50
going to pretend like someone who's not
11:54
lazy and tired which means this feeling
11:57
doesn't lead to the thought of I must
11:59
rest we don't have to change how we feel
12:03
we can keep feeling lazy or tired but by
12:06
pretending and Faking It pretending and
12:09
doing the actions of someone who doesn't
12:12
feel that way we are able to keep doing
12:14
the actions that we need to do my old
12:17
powerlifting coach put at the best when
12:19
one day I asked him hey I'm feeling
12:21
really tired today I don't think I be
12:23
have to train very well how do you stop
12:26
feeling tired and he replied back just
12:29
train tired what a man and the
12:32
ridiculously powerful part of this
12:35
relationship between feelings and
12:37
thoughts and actions is that it goes
12:40
both ways when we do the actions of
12:43
someone who isn't lazy or tired even if
12:45
it's just pretending and faking it then
12:48
our mind observes the fact that we're
12:51
taking these actions and starts thinking
12:54
hey maybe I'm not so lazy maybe I'm kind
12:56
of productive and that actually makes
12:59
must feel less lazy and tired in the
13:02
first place and in doing that we have
13:03
actually made ourselves more motivated
13:07
so feelings and thoughts don't just lead
13:09
to actions actions can also trigger us
13:12
to have certain thoughts which change
13:15
the way that we feel so by doing step
13:17
one and step two of defuse and unlocking
13:21
thought action defusion we're able to
13:24
act without feeling the need to act
13:28
we're no longer a slave to motivation
13:30
and that is a huge win but once we get
13:33
to this point we'll realize that we can
13:35
only maintain this defused state for a
13:38
short period of time and so now we want
13:41
to maintain this defusion for a longer
13:45
time period if we don't maintain it we
13:47
just end up being dependent on our
13:49
feelings again which brings us all the
13:50
way back to motivation dependent and
Step 3
13:52
that's why we have step three of Defuse
13:55
The U which stands for uptime we want to
13:58
gradually increase the amount of time
14:01
we're able to activate that thought
14:03
action defusion State and do those
14:05
actions even if we don't feel like it at
14:08
first we might only be able to get
14:09
through 10 minutes of studying great
14:12
that's fine tomorrow we try 12 minutes
14:14
and then 14 and then 20 and then 30
14:17
gradually increase the uptime that we
14:19
can maintain thought action defusion for
14:22
and as we continue to expose our brain
14:24
to this pattern of thinking and acting
14:28
thanks to this cognitive phenomenon
14:30
called
14:31
neuroplasticity our brain will mold and
14:34
adapt and eventually just get better and
14:36
better at activating thought action
14:38
defusion now some people when I teach
14:41
this to them they say that it seems like
14:43
we're kind of training ourselves to
14:46
become mindless robots it doesn't really
14:48
feel natural or right but it's important
14:52
to remember that a lot of our modernday
14:55
challenges and goals and pressures are
14:57
not natural to begin with back when we
15:01
were living in caves and foraging for
15:03
food we didn't come back to our campfire
15:07
every night to sit an exam on the herbs
15:09
that we forag and Cave person Society
15:11
probably didn't care which cave
15:13
University you went to most of our
15:15
modernday goals and pressures are modern
15:19
day creations and to meet these
15:21
artificial demands while staying healthy
15:24
we need to use these deliberate
15:26
Frameworks and techniques to help
15:29
overcome them using strategies like
15:31
defuse is what gives us the freedom to
15:35
live our lives in alignment to how we
15:38
want to live and spend our time having
15:40
said that just because we are constantly
15:44
exposed to and surrounded by these
15:45
artificial distractions doesn't mean we
15:48
just have to sit there and struggle
15:49
through them after all if there were
15:51
just literally fewer barriers in place
15:54
then it will be easier to achieve our
15:56
goal which is why step four the Z in
Step 4
16:00
defuse is so important which stands for
16:03
Zone to maintain consistency and reduce
16:06
our need for motivation we have to
16:08
create a zone of focus free from
16:11
distraction and procrastination triggers
16:14
a great technique I teach in my program
16:15
for this is the distraction cheat sheet
16:18
do some work or study and anytime you
16:20
get distracted write down on a piece of
16:22
paper what it was you got distracted by
16:24
try to be specific it could be the icon
16:27
of an app that you saw on your desktop
16:29
top or on your phone maybe it was a
16:31
notification that you got or you saw a
16:33
game controller sitting on the table
16:35
then when you're feeling a little less
16:36
lazy remove those distractions and
16:39
triggers from your environment hack your
16:41
game controller away remove apps from
16:44
your home screen or deactivate accounts
16:46
use app blockers like focused work and
16:49
create a focused workspace with all of
16:52
your study or work materials laid out
16:54
there just ready for you to sit down and
16:56
start over time your Zone of focus
17:00
becomes an area that distractions cannot
17:02
touch and by this point you've completed
17:04
all four steps of diffuse you are
Putting it all together
17:07
motivation enhanced you are free from
17:09
the shackles of motivation dependence
17:11
you are never going to look for another
17:13
motivational video ever again now it's
17:14
not a magic pill it does take time to
17:17
practice this and get bitter at it but
17:19
it is a proven strategy that pretty much
17:21
anyone can do now if you found this
17:23
video helpful you'll also find my weekly
17:25
